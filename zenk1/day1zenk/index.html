<h2>Making Pancakes</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes</li>
    <li>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes</li>
    <li>Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
    <li>Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
    <li>Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
</ol>
